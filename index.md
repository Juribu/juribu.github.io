# Hi, my name is Jay 👋

I’m a Statistics and Computer Science minor student at Cornell University, interested in building technology that bridges human and machine understanding. I enjoy working on data-driven systems, interactive AI, and iOS develeopment that foster meaningful connections and solves day to day problems with people.

Outside of tech, I love archery, playing video games, cooking, and enjoying poker nights with my friends!

I’d love to chat – send me an email at [jz2384@cornell.edu](mailto:jz2384@cornell.edu).
